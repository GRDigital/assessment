* create an input field and two buttons
* one button should perform a youtube api call to get title, views, duration and display it on the page
	* https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/videos/list
	* https://insomnia.rest
	* we can provide an API key in interest of saving time
* the other button should download the youtube video onto the server
	* https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl
	* `youtube-dl -g <URL>` would dump two urls - one audio, one video
